# Bolt Utility Mod for Minecraft Bedrock, Windows 10 Edition

***Bolt*** is a Utility Mod (written in C++) for Minecraft Bedrock Windows 10 Edition, ___Bolt___'s SDK does offer a "multi-version" support allowing it to support on different versions of the game, however the Packet related stuff will always be hardcoded to support only the latest version of the game so expect bugs with packet related modules when using versions of the game such as ***1.17.34***
